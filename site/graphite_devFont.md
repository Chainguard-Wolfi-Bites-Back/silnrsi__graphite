# Font Development

## Overview

Adding Graphite support to a font involves:

* writing a program using Graphite Description Language (GDL) describing the behavior of the font
* compiling the program along with the font to create the Graphite-enabled version of the font
* testing and debugging your smart font using a Graphite-enabled application

> To add Graphite support to a font, the font's license must grant you permission to modify it.

1. The GDL program

GDL is a programming language that describes the "smart" behavior of the font. It is written to correspond to a specific font, and includes definitions of the glyphs in the font and rules describing their behavior.
